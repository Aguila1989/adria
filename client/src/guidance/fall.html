                Prevent overcrowding around the casualty. Make space so that he or she can breathe better.<br>
                Do not move the casualty unless there are life-threatening hazards; He or she may have suffered a neck
                or spinal injury from the fall.
                If the casualty tries to get up or bystanders try to make him sit or stand, advise the casualty to
                remain in a lying position.<br>
                Tell the casualty not to move his or her head; Place two objects, like bags or cushion, on both sides of
                the head to keep it in that position.<br>
                Examine the limbs and hips for fractures. If possible, splint up the fractures so that the paramedics do
                not waste time when they arrive.<br>
                Continue to monitor the casualty; If at any time the casualty stops breathing, begin CPR.<br>

                Chew and swallow an aspirin while waiting for emergency help. Aspirin helps keep your blood from
                clotting. When taken during a heart attack, it could reduce heart damage. Don't take aspirin if you are
                allergic to it or have been told by your health care provider never to take aspirin.<br>
                Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed. If you think you're having a heart attack and your health care
                provider has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed while waiting for
                emergency medical help.
            </p>
            <p>Begin CPR if the person is unconscious. If the person isn't breathing, or you don't find a pulse, begin
                CPR to keep blood flowing after you call for emergency medical help.<br>
                Push hard and fast in the center of the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm â€” about 100 to 120
                compressions a minute.<br>
                If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is immediately available and the person is unconscious,
                follow the device instructions for using it.

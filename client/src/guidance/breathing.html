            <p>Lift the chin and listen if he is breathing, look at the chest at the same time to see if it moves.
                A mirror can also help to check for damp.<br>

                If the victim isn’t breathing normally, pinch closed his nose, cover his mouth with yours and blow into
                his mouth twice.
                <br>

                As you are breathing, watch for the victim’s chest to rise.
                <br>

                If the victim is still not breathing, begin chest compressions. Place your hands in the middle of the
                victim’s chest, directly between his nipples. Push down 15 times. You should compress the chest about
                two inches.
                <br>

                After 15 compressions, give the victim two breaths. After four cycles of breaths and compressions,
                recheck for signs of breathing or circulation. Continue CPR until signs of life return or paramedics
                arrive to take over.

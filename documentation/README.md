## Using the Software

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
- A working Adria Wristband
- A valid Adria ID & Authenticator (consult local Identity Services if errors occur)
- A validated ResQ Account (can be created when using our application for the first time with the prerequisites above)

### Usage

Description per Webpage

#### Choose Plan:
This page lets a new user choose a subscription plan from ResQ, ResQ+ and ResQ Pro.
The freemium plan allows a user to access a limited version of our application with advertisement. 
ResQ+ has the same features as the freemium version but with additional functionalities. 
And the same goes for ResQ Pro that adds even more functionalities for a higher cost.

#### Confirm Plan:
When the user chose a plan, he gets directed to a confirmation page where he can check the plan's 
subscription amount monthly or yearly. He can review the features linked to the subscription plan again and confirm his choice.

![confirm plan](/images/flow/choosePlan2.png)

#### Full Dashboard:
This page allows the user to access the feature he has access to. 
Freemium users will only have a limited version and will only have access to "Stats" & "AI Diagnosis" for example.
Some additional links can be found in this page that lead to "Settings", "Emergency Guidance" & "Emergency Alert".

![dashboard](/images/flow/fullDashboard.png)

#### Metrics:
Our metrics page allows users that see their health statistics live.
Stats such as "BPM" & "Saturation" are included in the Freemium plan as the rest can be overviewed with paid subscriptions.

![metrics](/images/flow/metrics.png)

#### Timeline:
As the name implies, our "Timeline" page displays the graphics for each of the users' health metrics.
These can be used to detect certain patterns and time frames where the user had health issues.

![metrics](/images/flow/timeline.png)

#### AI Diagnosis:
The "AI Diagnosis" page is where AvA really shines, she will take your symptoms into account and match them to a disease. 
Your obvious and testable symptoms are automatically stored and the user can manually add more.

![diagnosis](/images/flow/diagnosis.png)

#### Personal History:
The "Personal History" page goes with the AI Diagnosis, as it tracks and stores all your recorded diagnosis.
Not only does it store AvA generated files but doctors can also add their own diagnosis.

![history](/images/flow/personalHistory.png)

#### Settings:
As the name implies, "Settings" is the page where users can modify your account settings. 
The main accessible setting is "Subscription", where users can modify their plan.
On top of that, Premium Users have access to a "Customization" setting where they can change AvA's skin.

![settings](/images/flow/settings.png)

#### Emergency Guidance:
AvA is also able to detect emergency situations and give valuable insight and advices. 
Every situation is accounted for, and she can guide users to same themselves or others.

![guidance](/images/flow/emergencyGuidance.png)

#### Emergency Alert:
On top of guiding users, AvA is also able to contact the closest emergency services. 
After a short amount of time (needed to confirm the severity of the emergency) medical services will be alerted.
